## Chapter 1 Good Parts

When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the 'language of the web' by default. 
it's the language of the web browser. The Web has become an important platform for application development,
and java script is the only language that is found in all browsers.
its association with the browser makes it 
one of the most popular language in the world.
if you have a web browser and any text editor, you have everything you need to run javascript programs.

the very good ideas include functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation.
the bad idears include a programming model based on global variables.

lisp in C's clothing.
